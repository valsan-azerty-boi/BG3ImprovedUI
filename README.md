### Disclaimers
The contributors to this mod don't owe you anything; they do this mostly in their spare time, and they're tearing their hair out trying to find every possible solution to your problems. Please be kind to them.

For modders and players:
- Do not use this mod at the same time as any other version of ImpUI, you must use only one version at the same time
- Conflicts between mods exist sometimes
- This mod should not be set as a strict dependency in a mod meta file, the dependency should not be hard-coded in the meta file
- Also, if a mod have a strict dependency on load to "ImpUI (ImprovedUI)" mod, the responsability is to the mod author to delete this strict dependency, the dependency should not be hard-coded in the meta file
- Also, if a mod have a strict dependency on load to the old "ImprovedUI Assets" package, the responsability is to the mod author to delete this strict dependency, the dependency should not be hard-coded in the meta file

In general, all these steps can also be applied if a future patch or hotfix comes out; these are reflexes to have:
- PC: Don't use multiple mod managers to manage your mods, choose one and stick with it as much as possible
- PC: If you are using an external mod manager such as BG3MM, do not skip any updates to your mod manager or you risk having broken load orders and broken `modsettings.lsx` files
- PC: Vortex mod manager is not recommanded
- PC: Start fresh and delete `%AppData%\..\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\PlayerProfiles\Public\modsettings.lsx`
- PC: Delete the contents from folder `%AppData%\..\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\LevelCache`
- PC: Delete all your mods from folder `%AppData%\..\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods`
- PC: Delete all your mods from folder `%AppData%\..\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Local Mods`
- PC: Don't forget to enable & deploy your new mod list, it should create a new `modsettings.lsx`
- When a new update drop for Baldur's Gate 3, it's cleaner to re-download the game from scratch (because sometimes, when the game is updated, it keeps old update files from old version of the game and this makes the game unstable)
- It seems that ImpUI for Patch 8 works better for some people at the bottom of the load order, but it is not recommanded, ImpUI should be one of the first mod in your load order
- Do not use old saves from before patch 8, more specifically modded saves, start with a fresh new playthrough once you have reinstalled ImpUI and your mods for Patch 8
- Do not use any UI mods that have not been updated for Patch 8 in addition to ImpUI
- Do not update Baldur's Gate 3 in the middle of a playthrough
- Do not update your mods in the middle of a playthrough
