In general, all these steps can also be applied if a future patch or hotfix comes out; these are reflexes to have
- PC: Don't use multiple mod managers to manage your mods, choose one and stick with it
- PC: If you are using an external mod manager such as BG3MM, do not skip any updates to your mod manager or you risk having broken load orders and broken `modsettings.lsx` files
- PC: Vortex mod manager is not recommanded
- PC: Start fresh and delete `%AppData%\..\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\PlayerProfiles\Public\modsettings.lsx`
- PC: Delete the contents from folder `%AppData%\..\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\LevelCache`
- PC: Delete all your mods from folder `%AppData%\..\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods`
- PC: Delete all your mods from folder `%AppData%\..\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Local Mods`
- PC: Don't forget to enable & deploy your new mod list, it should create a new `modsettings.lsx`
- All Platforms: When a new update drop for Baldur's Gate 3, it's cleaner to re-download the game from scratch (because sometimes, when the game is updated, it keeps old update files from old version of the game and this makes the game unstable)
- All Platforms: It seems that ImpUI for Patch 8 works better for some people at the bottom of the load order, but it is not recommanded, ImpUI should be one of the first mod in your load order
- All Platforms: Do not use old saves from before patch 8, more specifically modded saves, start with a fresh new playthrough once you have reinstalled ImpUI and your mods for Patch 8
- All Platforms: Do not use UI mods that have not been updated for Patch 8 in addition to ImpUI
- All Platforms: Do not update your mods in the middle of a playthrough
